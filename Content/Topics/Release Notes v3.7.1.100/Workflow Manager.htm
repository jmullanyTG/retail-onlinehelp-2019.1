        <h1>Workflow Manager</h1>
        <p>The following enhancement is now available in the Workflow Manager solution. </p>
        <h2>User Blacklist Rights and the nightly Workflow Heartbeat job <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="General.Temp Exclude">DMDEV-57224</MadCap:conditionalText></h2>
        <p>The system now takes into account the User Blacklist Rights that is used for the nightly Workflow Heartbeat job to determine if a Price Action, Promotion, or Event should be automatically advanced to the next Workflow Status based on the appropriate solution object's current Status State:</p>
        <p>The system will evaluate the user's User Right to 'Modify Status' based on the solution object's current Status’ State:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>If the Job User does not have User Rights to 'Modify Status' based on the current Status State nor permission to the Transition, the system <b>will not</b> change to the next Workflow Status.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>If the Job User has User Rights to 'Modify Status' based on the current Status State AND permission to the Transition, the system <strong>will</strong> change to the next Workflow Status.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
