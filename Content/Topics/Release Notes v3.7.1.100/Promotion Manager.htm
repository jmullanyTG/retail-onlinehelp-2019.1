        <p>The following promotion-related enhancements are now available.</p>
        <h2>Validation logs <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="General.Exclude from Print,General.Temp Exclude">DMDEV-57481</MadCap:conditionalText> </h2>
        <p>Advanced filtering has been added to the Validation Log to let users review and mark as reviewed (override) validation failure records allowing Promotions to continue to downstream systems.  Additionally, the Validation log now returns large record sets. The new filters are: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Error Encountered</li>
            <li>Error Overridden</li>
            <li>Warning Found</li>
            <li>Warning Overridden</li>
            <li>Information Provided</li>
            <li>Information Overridden</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Users can select multiple filters as required.</p>
        <h2>Promotion strategy restrictions <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="General.Exclude from Print,General.Temp Exclude">DMDEV-55681</MadCap:conditionalText> <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="General.Temp Exclude">DMDEV-55681 DMDEV-55682</MadCap:conditionalText></h2>
        <p>Users can now be restricted to which promotion strategies they can use via a new button labeled Edit (Edit User Access column) on the Promotion Strategy tab on the Promotion Configuration screen. To access the Promotion Configuration screen, select Influence&#160;&gt; Promotion &gt; Configuration. Click Edit to display the Remove User Rights screen in which you add or remove user access to particular promotion strategies.</p>
        <p>Users will only have visibility to those promotion strategies for which they have access. When creating a new promotion, the strategies that display in the Promotion Strategy dropdown list on the Create New Promotion screen are filtered based on the user’s access.</p>
