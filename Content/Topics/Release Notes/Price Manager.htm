        <h1>Price &amp; Markdown</h1>
        <p>The following enhancements are now available in the Price Manager solution. </p>
        <h2>Advanced Variant Item Master filtering<MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="General.Temp Exclude"> <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="General.Exclude from Print">DMDEV-58470</MadCap:conditionalText></MadCap:conditionalText></h2>
        <p>A new menu option has been added to the Price Action Summary menu to display the Advanced Product Exclusion dialog. The dialog lets users exclude or re-include products at all levels: Variant, Item Master and Inventory.  Multiple selections at a product parent level display the summary of children at the lower levels for modification. No additional User Rights are needed beyond the current ability to 'Edit a Price Action'.</p>
        <h2>Cloning price actions</h2>
        <p>Price actions can now be cloned on the Price Manager Actions screen. Clicking the Clone button lets users quickly create a new price action based on an existing price action. Users require the access to create price actions. All Price Action Strategy values will remain intact while the system evaluates any change to Cost and Price based on the new Price Action Start Date.</p>
        <h2>Price Strategy User\Role Restrictions <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="General.Exclude from Print,General.Temp Exclude">DMDEV-56906</MadCap:conditionalText></h2>
        <p>As of v2019.1, users can now be restricted to which price strategies they can use via a new button labeled Edit (User Access column) on the Price Strategies tab on the Price Manager Configuration screen. </p>
        <p>To access the Price Manager Configuration screen, select Influence&#160;&gt; Price and Markdown &gt; Configuration. On the Price Strategies tab, click Edit to display the Remove User Rights screen in which you add or remove user access to particular price strategies.</p>
        <p>Users will only have visibility to those price strategies for which they have access. When creating a new Price Action, the strategies that display in the Price Action Strategy dropdown list on the Create New Price Action screen are filtered based on the user’s access.</p>
        <h2>Validation log <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="General.Exclude from Print,General.Temp Exclude">DMDEV-57489</MadCap:conditionalText></h2>
        <p>New filters have been added to the Validation Log to let users review and mark as reviewed validation failure records allowing Promotions to continue to downstream systems.  Additionally, the Validation Log no longer limits the number of records returned. The new filters are: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Error Encountered</li>
            <li>Error Overridden</li>
            <li>Warning Found</li>
            <li>Warning Overridden</li>
            <li>Information Provided</li>
            <li>Information Overridden</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Users can select multiple filters as required.</p>
        <h2>Ability to filter product validation failures <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="General.Temp Exclude"><MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="General.Exclude from Print">DMDEV-58717</MadCap:conditionalText></MadCap:conditionalText></h2>
        <p>As of v2019.1, the system will pre-filter product validation failures based on where you initialize the Validation Log (e.g. Price Action, Price Cluster, Variant, etc.). Additional filtering can then be implemented by the user.</p>
        <p MadCap:conditions="General.Exclude from Print,General.Temp Exclude">DMDEV-56894</p>
        <h2>Restrictions on special characters removed <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="General.Temp Exclude"><MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="General.Exclude from Print">DMDEV-57805</MadCap:conditionalText></MadCap:conditionalText></h2>
        <p>Prior to v2019.1, users were prevented from including special characters in Pricing Plan or Price Action names. This constraint is now removed.</p>
        <h2>Ability to copy Variant Codes from the Product Grid Control <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="General.Exclude from Print,General.Temp Exclude">DMDEV-57673</MadCap:conditionalText></h2>
        <p>A new right-click option labeled <b>Copy Column Cell(s)</b> lets users copy Variant Codes from the Product Grid Control. This allows for the creation of a new Price Action for only the copied variants. </p>
