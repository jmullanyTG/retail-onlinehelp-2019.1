        <h2>Clusters with zero sites <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="General.Temp Exclude"><MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="General.Exclude from Print">DMDEV-56801</MadCap:conditionalText></MadCap:conditionalText></h2>
        <p>Two new columns (Health Error and Health Error Details) and a health indicator (Health %) have been added to provide more visibility if a cluster has zero sites in a time frame so assortments can be better planned. </p>
        <h2>Assorting based on future cluster sets <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="General.Exclude from Print,General.Temp Exclude">DMDEV-56800</MadCap:conditionalText></h2>
        <p>Functionality has been added to allow assorting based on current and future cluster sets, depending on the time period being worked with, to avoid assortment plans being over- or under-estimated.</p>
