        <h2>Forecast Fulfillment Split Factors view <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="General.Exclude from Print,General.Temp Exclude">DMDEV-58519</MadCap:conditionalText></h2>
        <p>A new tab labeled Forecast Fulfillment Split Factors has been added to the to the Item Manager solution. This tab shows the calculated fulfillment split factors. The split factors are displayed based on Item Master and are read-only. If fulfillment data exists, then checking the "Show Zero Values" parameter displays any destination sites that have that Item Master but don't have a split factor. If fulfillment data doesn't exist, then the pivot grid only shows the Product Description column while Site, Destination, and Split Factors are all null.</p>
