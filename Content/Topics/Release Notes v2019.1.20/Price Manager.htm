        <p>The following enhancements are now available in the Price Manager solution. </p>
        <h2>Changing multiple Price Action statuses at once</h2>
        <p>You can now change the status of multiple Price Actions at once thus avoiding having to open and change the status for each and every Price Action. The changing of multiple statuses at once is effected using a new Multiple Price Action Status dialog. Select Change Status(es) either in the Price Actions grid on the Price Manager screen or within the Pricing Plan’s Action grid. The system will allow the user to review all Pricing Actions, in the grid, that they have rights to transition to the next Status per each Price Action’s specific workflow.<MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="General.Temp Exclude">DMDEV-60475.DMDEV-60474.DMDEV-60473</MadCap:conditionalText>.</p>
