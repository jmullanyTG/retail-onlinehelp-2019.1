        <h2>Changing multiple Promotion statuses at once</h2>
        <p>You can change the status of multiple Promotions at once thus avoiding having to open and change the status for each and every Promotion. The changing of multiple statuses at once is effected using a new dialog. </p>
        <p>Selecting the Change Status(es) menu option on the Promotions screen will allow the user to review all Promotions in the grid that they have rights to transition to the next Status per each Promotion’s specific workflow.<MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="General.Exclude from Print,General.Temp Exclude">DMDEV-60472.</MadCap:conditionalText><MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="General.Exclude from Print,General.Temp Exclude">DMDEV-60471.</MadCap:conditionalText></p>

        <h2>Marking a Promotion as Private, Public, or Shared <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="General.Exclude from Print">DMDEV-59740</MadCap:conditionalText></h2>
        <p>New functionality allows a Promotion owner to now designate a Promotion as Private or Shared thereby restricting visibility and access to that Promotion to particular roles and users. </p>
        <p>The restricted Promotion’s privacy setting can later be changed to Public allowing all users visibility and access once the need for privacy has passed. Additionally, when cloning a Promotion the original privacy setting can be retained or changed on the Clone Promotion dialog. All historic Promotions within the system will be marked as Public with the upgrade.</p>
        <p>This functionality is extended within the Event solution restricting the ability to view the Promotions in the Event List and Layout screens as well as within the "Available Promotions" pane. Please review the Event management solution for additional details.</p>
