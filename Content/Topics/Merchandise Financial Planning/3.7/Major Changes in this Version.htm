        <h1>Changes</h1>
        <h2>Version 3.7.1 included the following major changes:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Auto Lock on Cell Change option</b>. Sales-related cell values can now lock themselves automatically  after you update them.&#160;When the new <b>Auto Lock on Cell Change</b> is enabled, each time you change the value of a sales-related metric in the grid, the system automatically locks the changed cell  as well as its related sales cells. This saves you from having to stop and manually click Lock  after each change, which is especially convenient when you want to to change a number of values in a plan. For more information, see <a href="Auto Lock on Cell Change.htm">Auto Lock on Cell Change</a>.</li>
            <li style="font-weight: normal;"><b>Restore Data Layout feature</b>. A new<b> Restore Data Layout</b> option replaces the  data fields displayed in the grid with those from another layout <i>without changing </i>the current pivots and filters. This lets you easily switch out metrics as you work without having to recreate your current product/location/time dimensions and filters. For more information, see <a href="Changing Data Layouts.htm">Changing Data Layouts</a>.</li>
            <li style="font-weight: normal;"><b>New folder structure for organizing layouts</b>. You can now save layouts in groups, reducing the clutter of the Restore Layout menu and making it easy to always find the layout you want to use. For more information, see <a href="Managing Layout Groups.htm">Managing Layout Groups</a>.</li>
            <li style="font-weight: normal;"><b>Consolidation of planning views into new Hybrid Financial Planning Grid. </b>A singe new planning view replaces the 3 planning views (Main Planning View, Comp/Non-Comp Planning View, and Sales By Type Planning View) that appeared in previous versions. For more information, see <a href="The Hybrid Financial Planning Grid.htm">The Hybrid Financial Planning Grid</a>.</li>
            <li style="font-weight: normal;"><b>DC&#160;stock can be split by supply chain. </b>The logic related to how stock is split among DCs has been improved. Now, a plan's supply chain is used to determine how stock should be split among DCs. For more information, see <a href="DC Stock Splits.htm">DC&#160;Stock Splits</a>.</li>
